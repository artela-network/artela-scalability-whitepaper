\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we discuss the parallel execution stack, which enhances the scalability of the Artela blockchain and provides applications with predictable performance. It enhances the traditional EVM with features such as predictive optimistic execution and async preloading, which optimize parallel transaction processing and I/O performance. The fast persistent storage layer improves storage efficiency, while the elastic block space model allows decentralized applications to request dedicated block space, further boosting network efficiency. These innovations make Artela EVM++ well-suited for integrating advanced technologies and supporting a wide range of decentralized applications.
